# Machine Learning in Crowd Modeling & Simulation: Final Project

In this project, we examine two algorithms used to approximate the Koopman operator, the dynamic mode decomposition, DMD, and its extension EDMD algorithms. 

The implementation of the algorithms can be found in the python files matching their names. 

## Task 2:
Applies the DMD algorithm on few examples ranging from one dimensional linear system to high dimensional non linear system.

## Task 4:
Applies the DMD and EDMD algorithm on a few examples including a linear system, Hopf bifurcation and the Hermite polynomials and compare their results.

## Task 5:
Applies the EDMD algorithm on a crowd simulation data.
